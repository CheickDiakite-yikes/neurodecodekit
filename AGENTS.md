# AGENTS.md — Codex / Agent Instructions

You are continuing **NeuroDecodeKit**, a research/build starter for making Brain2Qwerty-style neural language decoding accessible.

## Product principle

Keep the core loop brutally simple:

```text
manifest → selective download → tiny shard → event windows → baseline → CER/WER report → demo
```

Do not optimize for impressiveness before reproducibility. A boring baseline that everyone can run is more valuable than a clever architecture no one can validate.

## Hard constraints

1. **Do not download the full SpanishBCBL dataset by default.** It is roughly 262GB. All code must default to dry-run, listing, manifesting, or tiny selective patterns.
2. **Do not make clinical claims.** This is a research/dev kit for non-invasive decoding experiments, not a medical product.
3. **Respect CC BY-NC 4.0 constraints.** Treat the Brain2Qwerty code and SpanishBCBL data as noncommercial unless a separate license exists.
4. **Keep heavy dependencies optional.** The base repo should run tests without MNE, Torch, Zarr, or Hugging Face. Put heavy imports inside functions and raise helpful install messages.
5. **Prefer inspectable data formats.** Manifests should be JSONL/Parquet-friendly. Metadata should be easy to diff. Cache format should be chunked and compressed once Zarr is implemented.
6. **Measure complexity.** Every new pipeline stage should report storage footprint, runtime, and a human-readable summary.
7. **Avoid LLM-only illusions.** Always keep a language-model-only baseline so we do not accidentally credit the neural decoder for autocomplete.

## Immediate next task

The first 20-loop roadmap is complete except for the deliberately parked Loop
13 backend. Next, define a synthetic causal chunk/replay contract over
`NeuroTokenCache v0` before adding a learned encoder or causal decoder:

```bash
neurodecode inspect-neurotoken-cache \
  --cache cache/loop20_neurotoken/neurotokens_v0.npz
```

Specify chunk boundaries, bounded state, right context, flush behavior,
offline-versus-streaming equivalence, and measured producer latency using only
synthetic fixtures. Keep both observed S21 MEG holdouts and the S7 EEG result
frozen. Any future real-data acquisition remains dry-run by default and
requires explicit byte caps plus `--execute`.

## Acceptance criteria for next PR

- `python -m unittest discover -s tests` passes.
- CLI has useful `--help` text.
- New numerical or model dependencies remain optional.
- No full-dataset download can happen accidentally.
- Streaming tests cover multiple chunk boundaries and final partial chunks.
- Reports separate producer causality, decoder causality, right context, and
  measured end-to-end latency.
- Runtime, peak memory, state bytes, and artifact bytes stay under explicit caps.
- Docs explain exactly what was verified and what remains synthetic or untested.

## Style

- Small functions, explicit names, low magic.
- Use dataclasses for records.
- Use pathlib over string path manipulation.
- Pure-Python first; optional NumPy/MNE/Torch/Zarr only where needed.
- Include tests for each assumption about filenames, metrics, and shape transformations.
