# Codex Handoff — NeuroDecodeKit Starter

## State of the repo

This repo is a starter scaffold with working pure-Python components:

- CER/WER metrics
- simple keyboard-distance metric
- SpanishBCBL-style manifest parser
- safe tiny-selection JSON creation
- dry-run-by-default selective download command
- optional Hugging Face access helpers
- synthetic shard generator
- real `.fif` + `.mat` event-window extraction scaffold
- size-aware capped tiny-selection and dry-run download planning
- B2Q-mini NPZ cache schema v0 loader and metadata sidecar writer
- CLI smoke commands
- unit tests

The real extraction path is now present, but it is still a first-shard scaffold:
it must be validated against one explicitly selected SpanishBCBL `.fif` block
and matching `.mat` log before treating parser labels as authoritative.

## The north star

Build a developer experience layer for non-invasive neural language decoding:

```text
huge raw neurodata → tiny selected shard → reproducible cache → baseline decoder → honest report
```

This is not primarily a model repo. It is a **research loop repo**.

## Next 3 PRs

### PR 1 — Real event/window extraction for one downloaded block

Use MNE only inside optional functions:

```bash
pip install -e '.[neuro]'
```

Implemented scaffold:

```text
load_mat_events(path) -> event rows
extract_fif_mat_windows(raw, events, tmin=-0.2, tmax=0.3, sfreq=50) -> windows
neurodecode extract-windows -> `.npz` cache and extraction report
```

Acceptance criteria:

- Works on one block if the user has selectively downloaded it.
- Saves a tiny `.npz` first; Zarr can be PR 3.
- Emits shape summary: samples x channels x timepoints.
- Emits storage summary before/after preprocessing.

### PR 2 — Baseline + report

Implement a tiny baseline:

```text
template classifier / ridge / tiny conv if torch available
```

Report:

```text
CER
WER
keyboard distance
examples: target vs prediction
storage footprint
runtime
```

Acceptance criteria:

- One-command run on synthetic shard.
- One-command run on real tiny shard if available.
- Baseline is explicitly marked as a sanity check, not SOTA.

### PR 3 — Zarr cache + visual demo

Implement chunked cache writing after the `.npz` loop works. Then make the Gradio demo show target text, predicted text, CER/WER, keyboard-distance error, and a small neural-window visualization.

Acceptance criteria:

- Existing `.npz` path remains supported.
- Zarr writes metadata and source manifest.
- Demo can run on synthetic cache without real data.

## Recommended architecture

Keep the project layers clean:

```text
datasets/       file listings, manifests, download selection
preprocess/     MNE loading, event alignment, window extraction
cache/          NPZ first, Zarr later
models/         honest small baselines
training/       synthetic + real shard runners
evaluation/     metrics and reports
demo/           Gradio visualization
```

## Research questions to keep alive

1. How small can a useful Brain2Qwerty-like shard be?
2. Which preprocessing steps preserve the most accuracy per GB?
3. How much accuracy comes from the neural signal vs the language prior?
4. How much subject-specific calibration is truly needed?
5. Can a reusable “neurotoken” cache become the common interface?

## Important caveats

- SpanishBCBL is from healthy Spanish-speaking skilled typists, not locked-in patients.
- v1 is keystroke-aligned; v2 is more real-time/asynchronous, but v2 data is still embargoed according to the public repo.
- MEG is not consumer hardware. Treat hardware realism as a separate research track.
- The license is noncommercial.

## PR 1 status update

The real extraction path is now scaffolded as:

```bash
neurodecode extract-windows \
  --raw data/spanishbcbl_tiny/.../block1.fif \
  --events data/spanishbcbl_tiny/.../S1_block1.mat \
  --out cache/b2qmini_s1_block1.npz \
  --sfreq 50 \
  --tmin -0.2 \
  --tmax 0.3 \
  --picks meg \
  --max-events 200
```

Implementation notes:

- MNE, SciPy, and NumPy are imported only inside the real extraction path.
- Missing optional dependencies raise an install hint: `pip install -e '.[neuro]'`.
- The `.mat` parser supports common shapes: record lists, parallel time/label arrays, and numeric event matrices.
- Parser warnings are saved in metadata and printed when timestamps or labels are heuristic or absent.
- The command never downloads data; `download-selection` remains dry-run by default and still requires `--execute` for a real fetch.

Recommended next validation:

1. Run the synthetic smoke loop and unit tests.
2. Use `download-selection --execute` only for the tiny selected files.
3. Run `extract-windows` on one real `.fif` + `.mat` pair.
4. Inspect the `.npz` metadata warnings and confirm which `.mat` fields are the true keystroke timestamps/labels.

Next PR recommendation: build the PR 2 baseline/report loop on top of both `cache/synthetic_tiny.npz` and a real extracted `.npz` when available.

## Loop 3 status update

The safe tiny-shard selector is now closed for local planning:

```bash
neurodecode select-tiny \
  --manifest data/spanishbcbl_manifest.jsonl \
  --out data/tiny_selection.json \
  --max-files 4 \
  --max-total-gb 2

neurodecode download-selection \
  --selection data/tiny_selection.json \
  --local-dir data/spanishbcbl_tiny
```

Implementation notes:

- `select-tiny` persists safety limits, known bytes, missing-size counts, and warnings.
- Known-size selections prefer the smallest exact raw+log candidate.
- `download-selection` prints exact files and size estimates before dry-run or execution.
- `download-selection --execute` refuses unknown-size selections unless the user also passes `--allow-unknown-size`.

## Loop 4 status update

The B2Q-mini cache schema v0 path is now present:

```bash
neurodecode make-synthetic-shard --out cache/synthetic_tiny.npz --samples 64 --channels 8 --times 25
neurodecode load-cache --cache cache/synthetic_tiny.npz --metadata-out cache/synthetic_tiny.metadata.json
```

Implementation notes:

- `save_npz_cache` validates `windows`, `labels`, and optional event/channel arrays.
- `load_npz_cache` is the stable one-function loader for B2Q-mini `.npz` caches.
- Cache metadata is normalized with schema name/version, dimensions, array descriptors, warnings, and transformations.
- Synthetic caches are explicitly marked as not-real-neural data.
- Real extracted caches record source files, extraction params, parser warnings, and preprocessing transformations.
- `load-cache` prints a compact summary and can write a JSON sidecar for reports.

Next 20-loop recommendation: Loop 5, Metrics + Error Report v1. Build the report command on top of `load_npz_cache` so every baseline/report reads the same cache contract.
