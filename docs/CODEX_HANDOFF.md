# Codex Handoff — NeuroDecodeKit Starter

## State of the repo

This repo is a starter scaffold with working pure-Python components:

- CER/WER metrics
- simple keyboard-distance metric
- SpanishBCBL-style manifest parser
- safe tiny-selection JSON creation
- dry-run-by-default selective download command
- optional Hugging Face access helpers
- synthetic shard generator
- real `.fif` + `.mat` event-window extraction scaffold
- size-aware capped tiny-selection and dry-run download planning
- B2Q-mini NPZ cache schema v0 loader and metadata sidecar writer
- JSON/Markdown metrics report command
- CLI smoke commands
- unit tests

The real extraction path is now present, but it is still a first-shard scaffold:
it must be validated against one explicitly selected SpanishBCBL `.fif` block
and matching `.mat` log before treating parser labels as authoritative.

## The north star

Build a developer experience layer for non-invasive neural language decoding:

```text
huge raw neurodata → tiny selected shard → reproducible cache → baseline decoder → honest report
```

This is not primarily a model repo. It is a **research loop repo**.

## Next 3 PRs

### PR 1 — Real event/window extraction for one downloaded block

Use MNE only inside optional functions:

```bash
pip install -e '.[neuro]'
```

Implemented scaffold:

```text
load_mat_events(path) -> event rows
extract_fif_mat_windows(raw, events, tmin=-0.2, tmax=0.3, sfreq=50) -> windows
neurodecode extract-windows -> `.npz` cache and extraction report
```

Acceptance criteria:

- Works on one block if the user has selectively downloaded it.
- Saves a tiny `.npz` first; Zarr can be PR 3.
- Emits shape summary: samples x channels x timepoints.
- Emits storage summary before/after preprocessing.

### PR 2 — Baseline + report

Implement a tiny baseline:

```text
template classifier / ridge / tiny conv if torch available
```

Report:

```text
CER
WER
keyboard distance
examples: target vs prediction
storage footprint
runtime
```

Acceptance criteria:

- One-command run on synthetic shard.
- One-command run on real tiny shard if available.
- Baseline is explicitly marked as a sanity check, not SOTA.

### PR 3 — Zarr cache + visual demo

Implement chunked cache writing after the `.npz` loop works. Then make the Gradio demo show target text, predicted text, CER/WER, keyboard-distance error, and a small neural-window visualization.

Acceptance criteria:

- Existing `.npz` path remains supported.
- Zarr writes metadata and source manifest.
- Demo can run on synthetic cache without real data.

## Recommended architecture

Keep the project layers clean:

```text
datasets/       file listings, manifests, download selection
preprocess/     MNE loading, event alignment, window extraction
cache/          NPZ first, Zarr later
models/         honest small baselines
training/       synthetic + real shard runners
evaluation/     metrics and reports
demo/           Gradio visualization
```

## Research questions to keep alive

1. How small can a useful Brain2Qwerty-like shard be?
2. Which preprocessing steps preserve the most accuracy per GB?
3. How much accuracy comes from the neural signal vs the language prior?
4. How much subject-specific calibration is truly needed?
5. Can a reusable “neurotoken” cache become the common interface?

## Important caveats

- SpanishBCBL is from healthy Spanish-speaking skilled typists, not locked-in patients.
- v1 is keystroke-aligned; v2 is more real-time/asynchronous, but v2 data is still embargoed according to the public repo.
- MEG is not consumer hardware. Treat hardware realism as a separate research track.
- The license is noncommercial.

## Build notes and managed-environment constraints

Use `docs/BUILD_NOTES.md` as the durable working journal for future agents. It
records the loop timeline, local verification commands, environment blockers,
and case-study notes.

Current workstation constraints to preserve:

- Do not retry GitHub push/export from this Bain-managed workstation unless the
  user explicitly re-approves and the repository privacy/trust status is clear.
- An earlier Loop 5 workbook/tracker closeout path was interrupted by an
  admin/tooling block. The final closeout succeeded with the bundled
  spreadsheet runtime in `.codex_work/loop5_tracker_closeout/`.
- Keep tests and synthetic smoke paths independent of real SpanishBCBL data.
- Keep all real downloads explicit, capped, and dry-run first.
- Keep `.codex_work/` and any local helper artifacts out of commits.

## PR 1 status update

The real extraction path is now scaffolded as:

```bash
neurodecode extract-windows \
  --raw data/spanishbcbl_tiny/.../block1.fif \
  --events data/spanishbcbl_tiny/.../S1_block1.mat \
  --out cache/b2qmini_s1_block1.npz \
  --sfreq 50 \
  --tmin -0.2 \
  --tmax 0.3 \
  --picks meg \
  --max-events 200
```

Implementation notes:

- MNE, SciPy, and NumPy are imported only inside the real extraction path.
- Missing optional dependencies raise an install hint: `pip install -e '.[neuro]'`.
- The `.mat` parser supports common shapes: record lists, parallel time/label arrays, and numeric event matrices.
- Parser warnings are saved in metadata and printed when timestamps or labels are heuristic or absent.
- The command never downloads data; `download-selection` remains dry-run by default and still requires `--execute` for a real fetch.

Recommended next validation:

1. Run the synthetic smoke loop and unit tests.
2. Use `download-selection --execute` only for the tiny selected files.
3. Run `extract-windows` on one real `.fif` + `.mat` pair.
4. Inspect the `.npz` metadata warnings and confirm which `.mat` fields are the true keystroke timestamps/labels.

Next PR recommendation: build the PR 2 baseline/report loop on top of both `cache/synthetic_tiny.npz` and a real extracted `.npz` when available.

## Loop 3 status update

The safe tiny-shard selector is now closed for local planning:

```bash
neurodecode select-tiny \
  --manifest data/spanishbcbl_manifest.jsonl \
  --out data/tiny_selection.json \
  --max-files 4 \
  --max-total-gb 2

neurodecode download-selection \
  --selection data/tiny_selection.json \
  --local-dir data/spanishbcbl_tiny
```

Implementation notes:

- `select-tiny` persists safety limits, known bytes, missing-size counts, and warnings.
- Known-size selections prefer the smallest exact raw+log candidate.
- `download-selection` prints exact files and size estimates before dry-run or execution.
- `download-selection --execute` refuses unknown-size selections unless the user also passes `--allow-unknown-size`.

## Loop 4 status update

The B2Q-mini cache schema v0 path is now present:

```bash
neurodecode make-synthetic-shard --out cache/synthetic_tiny.npz --samples 64 --channels 8 --times 25
neurodecode load-cache --cache cache/synthetic_tiny.npz --metadata-out cache/synthetic_tiny.metadata.json
```

Implementation notes:

- `save_npz_cache` validates `windows`, `labels`, and optional event/channel arrays.
- `load_npz_cache` is the stable one-function loader for B2Q-mini `.npz` caches.
- Cache metadata is normalized with schema name/version, dimensions, array descriptors, warnings, and transformations.
- Synthetic caches are explicitly marked as not-real-neural data.
- Real extracted caches record source files, extraction params, parser warnings, and preprocessing transformations.
- `load-cache` prints a compact summary and can write a JSON sidecar for reports.

## Loop 5 status update - done

The metrics and error report path is implemented and Loop 5 is closed as of
2026-07-01.

Implemented command:

```bash
neurodecode report \
  --targets outputs/run_001/targets.txt \
  --predictions outputs/run_001/predictions.txt \
  --cache cache/synthetic_tiny.npz \
  --out-json outputs/run_001/metrics.json \
  --out-md outputs/run_001/report.md \
  --run-name run_001 \
  --split synthetic-smoke
```

Synthetic plumbing smoke is explicit:

```bash
neurodecode report \
  --cache cache/synthetic_tiny.npz \
  --identity-smoke \
  --out-json cache/synthetic_report.json \
  --out-md cache/synthetic_report.md
```

Implementation notes:

- Reports include CER, WER, exact-match rate, keyboard distance, example rows,
  runtime, warnings, and optional cache/storage metadata.
- `--identity-smoke` copies targets into predictions and warns that the result is not a model output.
- Real predictions should be supplied as one prediction per line and compared with explicit target rows.
- Report JSON and Markdown are both written from the same report dictionary.

Closeout verification:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_report tests.test_cli_report
python -m unittest discover -s tests
neurodecode report --help
neurodecode make-synthetic-shard --out cache/loop5_synthetic_tiny.npz --samples 32 --channels 4 --times 12
neurodecode report --cache cache/loop5_synthetic_tiny.npz --identity-smoke --out-json cache/loop5_synthetic_report.json --out-md cache/loop5_synthetic_report.md --run-name loop5_synthetic_identity_smoke --split synthetic-smoke
```

Observed result:

```text
Ran 8 tests
OK

Ran 45 tests
OK

Report JSON and Markdown were written with explicit identity-smoke warnings.
```

Loop 6 has since been completed; see the Loop 6 status update below.

## Loop 6 status update - done

The no-brain prior-only baseline is implemented and Loop 6 is closed as of
2026-07-01.

Implemented command:

```bash
neurodecode prior-baseline \
  --cache cache/synthetic_tiny.npz \
  --out-predictions cache/prior_predictions.txt \
  --out-json cache/prior_report.json \
  --out-md cache/prior_report.md \
  --run-name synthetic_prior_most_frequent \
  --split synthetic-smoke
```

Implementation notes:

- The command uses no neural signal and warns with `prior_baseline_no_neural_signal`.
- It supports `most-frequent`, `frequency-sample`, and `uniform-random` strategies.
- It reads eval targets from text rows or cache labels.
- It can fit priors from separate train targets or train-cache labels.
- If no train source is provided, it fits on eval labels and warns with
  `prior_fit_on_eval_targets_for_smoke_only`.
- Reports include a `baseline` metadata block in JSON and Markdown.

Closeout verification:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_prior_baseline tests.test_cli_prior_baseline tests.test_report
python -m unittest discover -s tests
neurodecode prior-baseline --help
neurodecode make-synthetic-shard --out cache/loop6_synthetic_tiny.npz --samples 32 --channels 4 --times 12 --classes 8
neurodecode prior-baseline --cache cache/loop6_synthetic_tiny.npz --out-predictions cache/loop6_prior_predictions.txt --out-json cache/loop6_prior_report.json --out-md cache/loop6_prior_report.md --run-name loop6_prior_most_frequent --split synthetic-smoke
```

Observed result:

```text
Ran 15 tests
OK

Ran 55 tests
OK

Prior-only smoke report wrote predictions, JSON, and Markdown.
exact_match_rate=0.1875
corpus_cer=0.8125

```

Historical next recommendation from Loop 6: Loop 7, Template /
Nearest-Centroid Baseline. Loop 7 has since been completed; see the status
update below.

## Loop 7 status update - done

The template / nearest-centroid baseline is implemented and Loop 7 is closed as
of 2026-07-01.

Implemented command:

```bash
neurodecode template-baseline \
  --cache cache/synthetic_tiny.npz \
  --train-fraction 0.5 \
  --out-predictions cache/template_predictions.txt \
  --out-json cache/template_report.json \
  --out-md cache/template_report.md \
  --run-name synthetic_template_nearest_centroid \
  --split synthetic-holdout
```

Implementation notes:

- The command uses cache windows and warns with `template_baseline_uses_neural_windows`.
- It uses nearest-centroid templates, not deep learning.
- The one-cache path uses deterministic stratified holdout by label.
- Real comparisons can use `--train-cache` and `--eval-cache`.
- Reports include baseline metadata in JSON and Markdown.

Closeout verification:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_template_baseline tests.test_cli_template_baseline tests.test_report
python -m unittest discover -s tests
neurodecode template-baseline --help
neurodecode make-synthetic-shard --out cache/loop7_synthetic_tiny.npz --samples 64 --channels 4 --times 12 --classes 4
neurodecode template-baseline --cache cache/loop7_synthetic_tiny.npz --train-fraction 0.5 --out-predictions cache/loop7_template_predictions.txt --out-json cache/loop7_template_report.json --out-md cache/loop7_template_report.md --run-name loop7_template_nearest_centroid --split synthetic-holdout
```

Observed result:

```text
Ran 13 tests
OK

Ran 62 tests
OK

Template smoke report wrote predictions, JSON, and Markdown.
exact_match_rate=1.0
corpus_cer=0.0
corpus_wer=0.0
```

The perfect synthetic score is expected because the synthetic cache has clear
class bump patterns. It validates plumbing, not real Brain2Qwerty performance.

Historical next recommendation from Loop 7: Loop 8, Tiny Conv / EEGNet-style
Baseline. Loop 8 has since been completed; see the status update below.

## Loop 8 status update - done

The optional tiny Conv / EEGNet-style baseline is implemented and Loop 8 is
closed as of 2026-07-01.

Implemented command:

```bash
neurodecode tiny-conv-baseline \
  --cache cache/synthetic_tiny.npz \
  --train-fraction 0.75 \
  --epochs 30 \
  --batch-size 16 \
  --learning-rate 0.02 \
  --out-predictions cache/tiny_conv_predictions.txt \
  --out-json cache/tiny_conv_report.json \
  --out-md cache/tiny_conv_report.md \
  --run-name synthetic_tiny_conv \
  --split synthetic-holdout
```

Implementation notes:

- PyTorch is imported only inside the real training path.
- The base install remains lightweight.
- The command defaults to CPU and one Torch thread.
- It shares the same single-cache holdout and train/eval-cache modes as
  `template-baseline`.
- Reports include model name, deep-learning flag, train/eval accuracy, loss
  history, and warnings.
- Missing Torch produces: `pip install -e '.[ml]'`.

Closeout verification:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_tiny_conv_baseline tests.test_cli_tiny_conv_baseline tests.test_report
python -m unittest discover -s tests
neurodecode --help
neurodecode tiny-conv-baseline --help
neurodecode make-synthetic-shard --out cache/loop8_synthetic_tiny.npz --samples 64 --channels 4 --times 12 --classes 4
neurodecode tiny-conv-baseline --cache cache/loop8_synthetic_tiny.npz --epochs 2
```

Observed local result:

```text
Focused tests: Ran 15 tests, OK (skipped=2)
Full tests: Ran 71 tests, OK (skipped=2)
CLI help: OK
Tiny-conv command on base venv: helpful missing optional dependency error
```

The skipped focused tests are the Torch training smoke tests. Torch is not
installed in the current Bain-managed venv, and no heavy ML dependency download
was attempted locally.

Next 20-loop recommendation: Loop 9, CTC Character Decoder Scaffold. Prove the
sequence-decoding interface on synthetic sequence data before making real timing
or alignment claims.
